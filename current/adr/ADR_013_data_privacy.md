## Decision

The application must working internationally and must be deployed in datacenters located on different continents.  

We want to avoid problems with different data processing legal notices in different countries. 

## Consequences

We don't want to store sensitive data. If required should be anonymized.  

All we want is to gather trips, and travelling data, and analytical data. The traveler decides manually to publish its trip details with marked locality points or not.
