# Title

Full-stack teams

## Status

**accepted**

## Context

Chosing the best way for collaboration to build software solutions is always challenging. There are many different technologies available on the market. Different teams have different goals. The bottlenecs are common when functional teams (e.g. fontent team, backend team, integration team etc.) cooperates with each other.  

## Decision

We decided that the full-stack (or even better cross-functional) team as a group of dedicated members who specialize in various fields of software development is the best choice for project realisation. The team can deliver complete solutions, they can communicate directly with the customer focusing on customers needs directly. 

The team can cooperate together on many diffrent fields without a bottlenecs. The team members have always the same goal. They can focus on building one or more components of the application and do it efficiently.

For non full-stack teams a lack of direct connection and communication with a customer is always a drawback.

## Consequences

People with required skills in different software development areas are needed to build a full-stack team.

Full-stack developers are great but very rare on the market.
