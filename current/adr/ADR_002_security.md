# Title

Security standards

## Status

**accepted**

## Context

Mobile application and web application must met security standards during designing and implementation process.

## Decision

The various global application security standards will be applied during software development to ensure proper security posture of solution on various layer of architecture of the solution.

## Consequences

During implementation and deployment we will use standards below:

* OWASP Application Security Verification Standard [OWASP ASVS](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)
* OWASP Mobile Aplication Security Verification Standard [OWASP MASVS](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-app-security/)
* Threat Modeling Process described by OWASP [TMP](https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling_Process)
	* including STRIDE (a threats categorization)
	* including DREAD (a risk model)
	* including various Application Security Framework 
* CIS Critical Security Controls [CCSC](https://www.cisecurity.org/controls)
* CIS Benchmarks [CISB](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks)
* MITRE ATT&CK Framework [ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/)
