# Title

Datacenter solution

## Status

**accepted**

## Context

For distributes solutions there is always a hardware management problem. Should we hire whole management team and manage hardware ourselves or use cloud-based solutions.

## Decision

We don't want to manage the whole infrastructure in multiple datacenters located all over the world. We want to apply ready-made solutions. We decided to deploy the system in the cloud.

We don't gather sensitive data so we can easily apply cloud solution.

## Consequences

There is always some time required to learn new tools but it is shorter than time required to manage the infrastructure on our own in longer period.
