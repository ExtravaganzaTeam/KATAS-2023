As a traveler, I want to select data sources to scan travel-related emails, so I want to activate or deactivate specified sources of information.  

### Acceptance Criteria

Scenario: The traveler selected not to scan email sorce for travel-related emails. The system updated the configuration. The new travel-related email appeared in the email system. The sytem skipped the incomming email. No data related to trip has been imported.

When the traveler views trip information in a dashboard he doesn't see the travel-related data from the email appeared.
