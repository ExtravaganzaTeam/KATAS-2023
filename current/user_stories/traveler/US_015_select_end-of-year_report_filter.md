As a traveler, I want to select report filtering criteria, so I want to decide what I will see on the end-of-year summary raport.

### Acceptance Criteria

Scenario: The traveler travel usage metrics has been gathered by system. The custom filtering criteria has been selected by traveler. The system generated end-of-year summary raport.

When the traveler views the generated report only selected metrics are included in it.
