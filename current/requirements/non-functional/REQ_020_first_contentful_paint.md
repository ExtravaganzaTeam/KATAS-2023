Several factors can affect page load speed. Here are some of the best methods:  
* Enable gzip compression - compression decreases the size of your files, allowing faster downloading,
* Optimize images - some of the typical culprits contributing to large page sizes are images. Generally, your pictures should be adequately sized and optimized according to the following: under 100 kilobytes, the exact size the picture will be shown, saved as JPG (unless it’s transparent, in which case use PNG).
* Turn on browser caching - when visitors return to your site, their browser redownloads files like scripts, images, and style sheets — unless you’ve enabled browser caching,
* Minify HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - minification removes redundant or unnecessary code without affecting performance,
* Lessen HTTP requests - reducing requests is the ultimate goal of page load optimization,
* Reduce server response time - hosting server plays a crucial role in load time, so knowing whether you have the best setup goes a long way,
* Consider implementing a CDN - content delivery networks are perfect for pages that serve many international locations or are looking for a speed boost to their regular hosting service. They vastly reduce request times by hosting your files across an extensive network of global servers.
