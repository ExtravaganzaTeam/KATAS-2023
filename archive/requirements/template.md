  There isn’t just one right way to specify requirements. One technique is simply to take a declarative
approach and write down each detailed thing the system needs to do.
For example:
During the time in which the “weld here” input is active, the
system digitizes the position of the electrode tip by reading the
optical encoders every 100 msec.
